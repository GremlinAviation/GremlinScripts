# Gremlin (Core)

Welcome to the Gremlin documentation! We're still building most of this out, so there will be some rough edges, but hopefully you'll be up and running in no time with whichever Gremlin Scripts you end up using in your own missions!

Gremlin is a framework for building these scripts around, so it doesn't do much on its own. Still, in case it proves useful for your own scripts, we've documented it anyway. Enjoy!
